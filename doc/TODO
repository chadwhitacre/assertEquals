consider an ASSERT_EQUALS_STOPWORDS environment variable
add ability to cancel a report refresh
use kbd in doc for screens
lame message when there is a syntax error
    get an ImportError on the TestCase rather than the syntax error
need console for program output before tests
    so we can use print

ScrollArea
    consider wrapping: scroll off bottom jumps back to top
    still some edge cases out there I think
SummaryScreen
    hard to debug inter-test problems
        i.e., run all tests and some break, but just run that one and they work
    remove TestCases, hit ctrl-L, the all still show up
    submodule bullet bug: GetResponder, GetResponders
    add new TestCase, hit ctrl-L, doesn't appear
        update: new one shows up, but replaces existing one
    spacebar from module doesn't refresh TestCases before running, so results look goofy
    shouldn't show TestCases with 0 tests
    coming from ErrorScreen, get:
          File "/usr/home/whit537/workbench/assertEquals/site-
            packages/assertEquals/interactive/screens/summary.py", line 323, in
            draw_content
          tpass5, tfail, terr, tall = self.summary.totals

        ValueError: need more than 0 values to unpack
    bug TestCase gone, get IndexError, q back to normal
    if you import a TestCase into another module, it shows up twice
DetailScreen
    should run and report on tests in the order they are defined, not alphabetically
    consider calling out line number of test somewhere, since that's the quickest way to jump to a test
    potentially annoying to get bumped back to summary when you passed a test on purpose
        but aren't done with that screen yet
    when focus is on result during refresh, refresh doesn't get refreshed
    down one, page down x2 error -- lost it, twice :^(
    up always beeps in result pane
ErrorScreen
    really want to use a real pager for this if we can
DebuggingScreen
    really want to use the underlying terminal for this if we can
    command history
    deal better with resizes
    try to keep scrollback (paging)
    color(!)



=====FUTURE=====
ModulesScreen
    highlight current selection better -- color!
    ooh! delete removes module from testing list until next reload?
    feedback while loading/updating
        better is progress bar, but that means progressive communication with "server"
        which is complicated because of program output or pdb sessions


=====DONE=====
SummaryScreen
    scroll off bottom of screen is buggy
    feedback while loading/updating
        spinning wheel is the easy out
    need to be smarter about which tests to show
        don't show modules for which all tests pass
        don't show modules for which there are no test
        unless a submodule of that module has tests
    highlighting
        fresh -- cyan
        stale -- dark blue
        un-run tests -- gray
        current modules -- bg
        current submodules -- bg
    bug: running 'task' yields no results!
    can't write to bottom left corner! -- hacked for now
    need to display totals
    really should have pgup/pgdn/home/end
    total highlight: white when unrun, red when failing, green when 100% passing
    currow should persist across runs
    bottom row should show current selection and stats
    bug: summary borks on base='assertEquals.test'
    bug: resize smaller borks
    bug: not using last row of listing
    bug: not seeing bottom continuation indicator
    need to do something with errors
    continuation indicators -> scrollbars!
    should refuse to attempt run for module with 0 tests
    annoying that F5 clears tests; that should be <ctrl>-F5
ModuleScreen -> SummaryScreen
DetailScreen
    Detail
    should immediately switch and then show 'working...'
    move module name to bottom
    make panes scroll -- includes arrows and continuation indicators
    format result with textwrap
    resize shouldn't trigger refresh
    consider putting the usual totals from summary in the footer (red/green)
    continuation indicators -> scrollbars!
    q: KeyboardInterrupt -> ESC
    enter -> opens traceback in ErrorScreen
    hitting enter should update stats before going to DetailScreen
    add left/right key support
    should only go to DetailScreen if tests don't pass
    trim module name in footer
    loses selection returning from DetailScreen
    result not cleaned between displays
refactor to account for TestCase in between module and individual tests
DebuggingScreen
    proxying a child process's stdin/stdout
    selectively triggering I/O proxing based on the output
    capture lines of input and pass them back to the client
    react to EOF
    exit cleanly
    safely restore curses state after exiting DebuggingScreen
